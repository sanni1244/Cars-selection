  Lamborghini V10 engine used in the Huracan GT3
  The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine from the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system.[citation needed] The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models. <br>

  <b  class="fs-4">Performance</b> <br>
  With a curb weight of 1,553 kg (3,424 lb), the Huracán LP610-4 has a power-to-weight ratio of 2.55 kg (5.62 lb) per horsepower. <br>

          <b class="fs-2">Specs & Info: </b> <br>
          <blockquote>
  
          The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more refined side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.

          The interior in the Divo is relatively similar to the more luxurious Chiron, but has Alcantara upholstery and carbon-fibre trim in order to save weight.
          
          Other notable changes include stiffer springs and dampers, carbon-fibre wiper blades and intercooler shroud, grooved wheel spokes, reduced sound insulation, a lighter sound system and removal of the storage lockers present in the doors and centre console for a weight saving of 35 kg (77 lb) over the Chiron Sport. The engine, a quad-turbocharged W16 unit, is retained from the Chiron along with the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.[3]

            <blockquote>
              Ferrari produced the 250 P in 1963 in response to the FIA introducing a prototype class for the upcoming season of the World Sportscar Championship. This was a new design, with a chassis unrelated to existing 250-series Grand Touring cars. Designed by Mauro Forghieri, the 250 P was an open cockpit mid-engined rear wheel drive design, utilizing a tubular space-frame chassis, double wishbone suspension, rack and pinion steering, four wheel disc brakes and a longitudinally-mounted V12 engine with a 5-speed gearbox and transaxle. The 250 Testa Rossa-type single-cam 3.0-litre engine was supplied by six Weber 38 DCN carburetors and produced 310 bhp at 7,500 rpm. This was the first time a V12 engine was mounted in the rear of a Ferrari sports racing car.

              The 250 P achieved immediate success on the racetrack, winning the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, 12 Hours of Sebring, 1000 km Nürburgring, and Canadian Grand Prix. The cars were raced by Scuderia Ferrari in Europe and NART in the Americas. Notable drivers included John Surtees, Ludovico Scarfioitti, Willy Mairesse, Lorenzo Bandini and Pedro Rodriguez.
              In total Ferrari produced four 250 P chassis (serial numbers 0810, 0812, 0814 and 0816) and one development mule based on a Ferrari 246 SP chassis (number 0796). All 250 P chassis were converted to 275 P or 330 P specification following the 1963 racing season

                    The 6.0 L (5,999 cc) Tipo F140 C V12 engine utilised in the 599 produces a maximum power output of 612 hp (456 kW; 620 PS) between 7,600 rpm to 8,400 rpm, which made it the most powerful series production Ferrari road car at the time of its introduction. When introduced, the engine was one of the few engines whose output exceeded 100 hp (75 kW; 101 PS) per litre of displacement without the use of forced-induction such as supercharging or turbocharging. Its 448 lbf⋅ft (608 N⋅m) of torque produced at 5,600 rpm was also a record for Ferrari's GT cars at the time. Most of the modifications to the engine were done to allow it to fit in the 599's engine bay (the original version used in the Ferrari Enzo would be taller and would block forward vision due to its mid-mounted position construction).[8]

A traditional 6-speed manual transmission was offered, as well as Ferrari's 6-speed automated manual paddle-shift transmission called "F1 SuperFast" which had a shift time of 100 milliseconds in the standard 599 or 85 milliseconds if equipped with the HGTE package.The 599 also saw the debut of Ferrari's new traction control system, F1-Trac. The vast majority of the 599 GTB's were equipped with the automated manual gearbox as opposed to the 6-speed manual gearbox. Only 30 examples were produced with a manual gearbox of which 20 were destined to the United States and 10 remained in Europe leading Ferrari to abandon the use of the manual transmission in its future GT cars. 599 GTB Fiorano was the last V12-engined Ferrari to be equipped with manual transmission.</blockquote>

                      <blockquote>
                        The Model S was styled by a team led by Franz von Holzhausen, who previously worked for Mazda North American Operations,[96] who drew upon the Mercedes Benz CLS 4-Door Coupe.[97] It was designed with an electric powertrain in mind,[98] unlike other electric vehicles where the manufacturer swaps an internal combustion engine with an electric motor.[99][100][101] As a result, the Model S offers features such as a front trunk (a "frunk") in addition to a rear trunk and an enlarged crumple zone.[102]

The Model S exists in several versions, differing in energy capacity (battery size), power (motor size), and equipment. It is classified as a full-size luxury car in the US, or as a "Large Car"[103] (greater than or equal to 120 cu ft or 3.4 m3) or "Luxury Sedan"[104] by the EPA. The Euro Car Segment classification is S-segment (sports car),[105][106] or "Oberklasse" (F-segment) in Germany.[107]

The roof was eventually transitioned to be made entirely of high-strength glass in ~2017, originally as an option but then made standard across the fleet. With this change the Panoramic sunroof was no longer an option. [108][109]

Powertrain
The Model S powertrain has evolved since its first release, increasing in efficiency, power, and durability. IN 2014 Tesla claimed that the Model S recovered the energy that went into producing it in fewer than 10,000 miles (16,000 km).[110]

The rear axle has a traditional open differential. Models with Dual Drive dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well. The front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage – with dual motors, the power distribution among them is controlled electronically.[111] With the introduction of the tri-motor Plaid version in mid-2021, new performance levels were achieved making the Model S Plaid the fastest accelerating production car in the world.

The powertrain provides regenerative braking power of more than 60 kW, which both reduces energy consumption and greatly reduces brake wear.

Battery

Tesla Model S battery is made of several thousand cylindrical cells (18650)
The battery pack includes thousands of identical 18650 battery cells, depending on the pack size. 18650 cells are cylindrical and are 18 mm in diameter, and 65 mm in height. Cells use a graphite/silicon[62] anode and a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode with an aqueous electrolyte and lithium ions as charge carriers.[112] Battery capacity has changed repeatedly as the technology has evolved, ranging from 60-100 kWH. As of 2021, the company preferred to cite vehicle range rather than battery capacity. The batteries are the car's heaviest component. E.g., the 85 kWh battery pack weighed 1,200 lb (540 kg).[better source needed] Tesla manufactures some Model S cells internally, and some in partnership with Panasonic.

Cell, group, module, pack

Model S chassis with powertrain and battery pack[114]
The P85 pack contained 7,104 lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules[115] wired in series (14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front).[116] Each module contained 6 groups of 74 cells[117] wired in parallel; the 6 groups were then wired in series within the module.

Lithium-ion batteries operate best at certain temperatures. The motor, controller and battery temperatures are controlled by a liquid cooling/heating circuit,[121] and the battery is uninsulated.[100] Waste heat from the motor heats the battery in cold conditions, and battery performance is reduced until a suitable battery temperature is reached.[122] The battery can be pre-heated by a 6 kW internal heater, either from itself using battery power, or from a charger.[100]

Placement
In contrast to most earlier battery electric vehicles including the Roadster, the battery pack of the Model S forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles, with several advantages:

The center of gravity height is 18 inches (460 mm)[113][123] (about the same as a Lotus Elise),[124] helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9 g[125] and rollover protection.[126][127]
The bulk of the mass is between the axles, which lowers rotational inertia and allows it to turn more quickly for its weight.
The battery cage increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment, improving passive safety.
Energy consumption
Under its five-cycle testing protocol, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the 90 kWh version at a combined fuel economy equivalent of 104 MPGe (2.26 L/100 km or 125 mpg‑imp), with an equivalent 102 mpg‑US (2.3 L/100 km; 122 mpg‑imp) in city driving and 107 mpg‑US (2.2 L/100 km; 129 mpg‑imp) on highways

                          The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[11] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[12][13]

                          Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[14][15][16] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[17]
                          
                          The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[18]
                          
                          The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.[2][19] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.[20] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US)

                        <blockquote>
                          The Aventador LP700–4 uses Lamborghini's new 700 PS (515 kW; 690 hp) 6,498 cc (6.5 L; 396.5 cu in) 60° V12 engine weighing 235 kg. Known internally as the L539,[11] the new engine is Lamborghini's fifth in-house engine and second V12 design. It is the first all-new V12 since the 3.5 litre powerplant found in the 350GT. <br>
                          0–100 km/h (0–62 mph): 2.9 seconds[17]
0–161 km/h (0–100 mph): 6.4 seconds[4]
400 m (1⁄4 mi): 10.5 seconds at 220 km/h (137 mph)
Top speed:
Official: 350 km/h (217 mph)[17][18]
Measured by Sport Auto magazine: 354 km/h (220 mph)[19]
97–0 km/h (60–0 mph): 30 m (100 ft)[citation needed]
Cornering – 1.05 g.[citation needed]
The transmission, a seven-speed single-clutch automated manual, is built by Graziano Trasmissioni.[20][21] Despite being single-clutch, gear-shifts are accomplished in 50 milliseconds.

The new, electronically controlled, all-wheel drive system is developed and supplied by the Swedish company Haldex Traction, offering traction[22] and handling capabilities based on their 4th generation technology.[23]

The Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 was replaced by the facelifted Aventador S in 2016.

                          <blockquote>
                            The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[11] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[12][13]
  
                            Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[14][15][16] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[17]
                            
                            The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[18]
                            
                            The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.[2][19] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.[20] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US)
